[OpenStreetMap](//osm.org) or OSM is a map of the world, freely editable, made by people like you. OpenStreetMap allows you to view, edit, and use geographic data around the world.

## Local Knowledge
OpenStreetMap emphasizes local knowledge. Contributors use aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM is accurate and up to date.

## Community Driven
OpenStreetMap's community is diverse, passionate, and growing every day. Our contributors include enthusiast mappers, GIS professionals, engineers running the OSM servers, humanitarians mapping disaster-affected areas, and many more. To learn more about the community, see the OpenStreetMap Blog, user diaries, community blogs, and the OSM Foundation website.

## Open Data
