We are excited to announce a groundbreaking partnership with Wiki Green Initiative for the 2023 Wiki Green Conference aimed at intensifying the call for environmental restoration. Wiki Green Initiative aims to build the capacity of young people in creating and editing climate change content on Wikipedia, while exploring cases regarding the use of OpenStreetMap for aggregated climate change initiatives.

Through this partnership, we hope to create a platform for stakeholders to collaborate on climate change initiatives and drive action towards environmental restoration. The conference will provide an opportunity for participants from both the Wikimedia and OpenStreetMap communities to contribute to a knowledge exchange of both platforms, in a bid to foster collaboration and integration. 

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and as such, it is important that we work together to create a sustainable future for all.

OpenStreetMap is already integrated into Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and Wikidata making it easier to explore the use of OpenStreetMap for aggregated climate change initiatives.

By creating maps that show areas of high risk, we can help communities and decision-makers to better understand the challenges they face and develop strategies for adaptation and mitigation.

We believe that the partnership between Wiki Green Initiative and OpenStreetMap Ghana will play a significant role in promoting environmental restoration and building a sustainable future for all. We look forward to working with everyone to achieve this important goal.

You can participate in the conference by joining us on the 19th and 20th of May, at the [Science and Technology Policy Research Institute https://omaps.app/4lX_7dlC2w/Science_and_Technology_Policy_Research_Institute] in Accra as we journey towards a more sustainable future.
