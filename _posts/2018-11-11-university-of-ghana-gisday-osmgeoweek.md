Geographic Information Science (GIS) Day was organized by the Geography Department, University of Ghana. OSM Ghana joined to celebrate geography and make maps with OpenStreetMap, the free and openly editable map of the world. OpenStreetMap Ghana supported YouthMappers at University of Ghana to build their capacity by training students from the Geography Department and some selected Senior High Schools within the country as part of the activities for the day.

The training was carried out at RS/GIS lab - Geography Department introducing the students to OpenStreetMap and mappng with iD editor; mapping their various communities. The students we taught them how to search, find palaces and how to map building. We had 7 sessions with almost 40 students per session. At the end of the training students were able to map a building and tag them building with little or no supervision. 

The students and Head of Department appreciated our time. OpenStreetMap Ghana community is always very grateful to the department for it's continous support for mentoring high school students in geography and its related fields.
