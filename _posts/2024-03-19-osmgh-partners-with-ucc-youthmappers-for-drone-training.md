In a bid to foster innovation and equip the youth with cutting-edge skills, OSMGhana recently collaborated with the University of Cape Coast (UCC) YouthMappers chapter to conduct an enlightening two-day training session on drone technology. 

The initiative aimed to introduce students to the exciting world of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and provide hands-on experience in utilizing drones for mapping purposes.

The training commenced with a comprehensive theoretical session covering various aspects of UAVs, including an introduction to drone technology, types of UAVs, their applications, understanding the controller, and prioritizing UAV safety. This foundational knowledge set the stage for the practical application that followed.

On the second day, students were immersed in the practical aspect of the training, where they were taken to the field for hands-on experience with drones. To our surprise, over one hundred students turned up.

With three different drones – *Phantom 4*, *Mavic 2 Pro*, and *DJI Mini 2* – at their disposal, participants learned the intricacies of drone operation in groups. From manually and automatically starting the drone to mastering manoeuvres such as rotation, lateral movement, forward motion, and altitude control, students gained proficiency under the guidance of expert trainers.

Emphasis was placed on safety protocols, ensuring that students understood the importance of responsible drone operation. They were educated on emergency landing procedures and techniques for landing the drone safely, even in challenging environments. Additionally, students were introduced to the concept of planning autonomous flight routes, further expanding their skill set and understanding of drone technology.

In addition to drone training, participants were introduced to the Mapillary application for capturing street-level imagery. Through hands-on guidance, they learned how to utilize this powerful tool effectively, enriching their understanding of mapping techniques and data collection and contributing open data through street-level imagery.

The success of the training session was bolstered by the presence and support of esteemed patrons, Dr. Juliana Qwecoe and Dr. Emmanuel Mensah, who served as sources of inspiration and motivation for the students throughout the event. Their encouragement further reinforced the importance of initiatives aimed at empowering the youth through education and skill development. We also think this event training couldn't have been this successful without the great coordination and team play of the whole executive team members; Wilfred Ruth Alifo Vivian Yorke, Gabriel, and Gifty Gyamerah.


The collaboration with UCC YouthMappers exemplifies the transformative impact of equipping the next generation with technological skills which are rapidly changing. Through immersive training sessions and hands-on experiences, students were empowered to explore new frontiers in drone technology and mapping applications. As they embark on their journey, armed with knowledge and practical skills, they are poised to make meaningful contributions to the fields of remote sensing science, technology, and innovation.

Special thanks to Mawutor and Calvin, seasoned experts in drone technology and Mapillary application, respectively, who served as dedicated trainers, ensuring an enriching learning experience for all participants.

Stay tuned for more updates and future collaborations as we continue to empower and inspire the leaders of tomorrow!
