#### 2. Practical Mapping Experience:

Despite limited resources (only two laptops), all students were allowed to experience mapping. The hands-on session aimed to enhance practical mapping skills among the students.
This gave all the students a wonderful experience on mapping using ID Editor. Students were asked to volunteer and share their experiences and their learnings from the practical session. Appreciation was shown by gifting those who actively participated and shared their experiences.
